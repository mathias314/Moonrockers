# About | Moonrockers - Robotic Mining Challenge

Programming a robot to compete autonomously (as much as possible) in the robotic mining challenge.

Please see more in-depth documentation in the System Document in the "about" project.

A high level overview of each of the folders in this project follows:

docker - The docker folder contains the content for the control station and robot docker container. Run the build.sh and run.sh script in order to launch the driver station and robot instances.

kinectPlaying - Contains scripts for running the obstacle detection script, using the Azure Kinect DK.

pd-board - Legacy files from the design of the power distribution from the 2021-2022 team.

ros - Code for all of the ROS nodes in the system. Includes both the control station docker containers and the robot docker containers. See the system doc for more detailed information and further information on how to build and use.

tags - Example AruCo tags.

uc - Contains code for the microcontrollers on the robot. Includes code for Woody and the final robot.
